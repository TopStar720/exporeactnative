1.
What is the difference between responsive and adaptive design?

Hide Answer
Responsive and adaptive design is used to create websites that work smoothly across multiple devices. Both design techniques provide a better user interface but have many differences.

A responsive design technique that involves designing a website layout adjusts that can adjust to any screen size. This means the website will look and function well on any device, whether a large desktop computer or a mobile phone. Responsive design relies on fluid grids to resize and rearrange the layout based on percentage values.

On the other hand, adaptive design is a design approach where a website is designed to have multiple layouts. Each layout is optimized for a specific screen size or device type. When users visit the website, it detects their device and displays the appropriate layout. Adaptive design uses fixed layout sizes for specific screen dimensions. This approach requires developers to create multiple layouts that correspond to predefined screen sizes or device capabilities.

2.
What do you mean by data attributes?

Hide Answer
A data attribute is a data field that defines the characteristics or features of a data object. It mostly exists in a table format but can also refer to special values for objects in programming languages. In a word, data attributes are simply data that describe other data.

Example:

3.
What is a web server?

Hide Answer
A web server is a computer that stores, processes, and delivers website content to browsers. When a user makes a request to the browser, it responds to the requests using HTTP and other protocols.

A web server is a combination of hardware and software. The hardware allows the exchange of data to the devices that make a request, while the software controls how the user can access the stored files.

4.
What is the difference between a static and dynamic website?

Hide Answer
A static website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and its content does not change every time you access it. When a user requests a page from the server, the server simply sends the HTML files to the user's browser, which displays the content to the user. Examples of static websites include personal blogs, brochure websites, and small business websites.

On the other hand, dynamic websites are built using server-side programming languages such as Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, or others and often use databases to store and retrieve information.

When a user requests a page from a dynamic website, the server runs the necessary code to generate the content for that page and sends it to the user's browser. This allows dynamic websites to display dynamic content to users. Dynamic websites include stock broker websites, social media platforms, content management systems, etc.

5.
How do you ensure code quality and maintainability in your projects?

Why is RESTful API a popular choice in web development?

Hide Answer
RESTful API is a popular choice in web development due to its several beneficial features and design principles that enhance the efficiency and maintainability of web services. Some of these features include Stateless, Scalable and performant, Cacheable, among others.

RESTful API is designed to be stateless, meaning each request sent from the client to the server must contain all necessary information for the server to process it. This prevents the server from having to maintain client state between requests, which simplifies the server's architecture and enhances scalability.

The stateless nature of RESTful API allows for better load balancing, horizontal scaling, and improved performance, as servers can more easily distribute the workload without the need to coordinate client states.

9.
Can you explain the MVC design pattern?

Hide Answer
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern is a widely used software architecture pattern in web development. It helps you turn complex software development into three separate components.

Model: This component represents the data and business logic of the application. It is responsible for managing the data, performing calculations, and responding to requests from the controller.

View: This component is responsible for the user interface of the application. It displays the data from the model to the users and provides a platform to interact with the application.

Controller: It is responsible for handling both the Model and View. It manages the flow of the application, including data flow within the Model object and updating the View whenever data is changed.

10.
Explain long polling.

Hide Answer
Long polling is a method used for getting a stable server connection without using protocols such as WebSocket or Server-Side Events. In the conventional client-server model, this method is at the top. In Node.js, the same technique is called the next development model.

The functioning of this method includes the sending of requests from the client to the server, with the server responding till the connection with new and unique information opens. When the server responds, the client can submit a request to the server. The server returns a query when there is data available. The function takes place when the application of the client and the requests of the server end.

11.
Which is the popular language used by full-stack developers?

41.
What is the difference between MVC (Model View Controller) and MVP (Model View Presenter)?

Hide Answer
The MVC pattern suggests splitting the code into three components. When developers create a class or file, they should categorize it into one of the three layers: Model, View, and Controller. On the other hand, the MVP pattern is an advanced iteration of software architecture. It is composed of three components: Model, View, and Presenter.

In the MVC pattern, the controller falls between the view and model layers, but in the case of the MVP pattern, an interface works as a communicator between View-Presenter and Presenter-Model.

The support for unit testing is limited in the MVC pattern, whereas unit testing is highly supported in the MVP pattern.

It handles the communication between the user interface, application logic, and data storage layers of an application.It provides the business logic behind any application.

When a client first makes a request, it goes to the web server, which sends it to the application server. The application server requests the information from the database server and sends it back to the web server. The web server sends the information to the client.

2.
How do you optimize SQL queries?

Hide Answer
Optimizing SQL queries means identifying the most effective techniques to enhance SQL query performance. Here are the most effective ways to optimize queries.

Indexing: It helps in accessing the database quickly to find the relevant data.

Use SELECT query instead of SELECT*: Use SELECT query to specify the columns you need instead of SELECT* to avoid unnecessary I/O operations that slow down the query.

Avoid too many JOINs: Use the appropriate JOIN type for your SQL query to ensure you get the desired results and minimize unnecessary processing.

Use subqueries: Using a subquery instead of a JOIN can be more efficient sometimes. If you only need to retrieve data from one table based on data in another, using a subquery can be faster than using a JOIN.

Use table aliases: Table aliases can make your query easier to read and write. Use aliases for tables and columns to make your query more readable.

Optimize database design: Optimize database design by avoiding redundant data and using appropriate data types. A well-designed database can help you improve query performance.

Use Wildcards: Using wildcards helps you search the database for matching results.

3.
How do you handle browser compatibility issues?

Hide Answer
Browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, etc., may interpret web code differently. As a result, a web page or application that looks and functions correctly in one browser may not work the same way in another. Here are a few tips to handle browser compatibility issues.

Use a CSS Reset: Different browsers have different design layouts, which can cause layout inconsistencies. A CSS reset can help by setting a common baseline for all browsers.

Use cross-browser frameworks and libraries: Cross-browser frameworks and libraries such as jQuery, React, or Angular can help developers avoid browser-specific code and provide a consistent interface across different browsers.

Test on multiple browsers and devices: Developers should test their websites or applications on multiple browsers, including popular ones such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, to check compatibility.

Use polyfills and shims: Polyfills and shims are code snippets that provide fallback functionality for web features not supported by some browsers. You can use libraries like Modernizr, Polyfill. io, or HTML5 Shiv to help fill in gaps in browser support.

4.
What is the difference between abstract and interface?

Hide Answer
An abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods, but an interface can only have abstract methods.
Variables declared in an abstract class may contain non-static and non-final variables, whereas those declared in a Java interface are only static and final.
An abstract class can provide an implementation of an interface. On the other hand, an Interface can’t implement an abstract class.
A Java abstract class can have public, private, and protected members, but an interface only has public members.
An abstract class can be extended using the "extends" keyword. An interface can be implemented using the "implements" keyword.
5.
Why and how do you clear floats in CSS?

Hide Answer
Using floats in CSS allows you to position elements (typically images) such that surrounding content can flow around them. However, when using floats, it may cause subsequent elements to flow around floated items, leading to undesired layout issues. Clearing floats is necessary to prevent such issues and ensure proper control of the layout.

There are multiple methods to clear floats in CSS. Some common techniques include:

Clear attribute: Use the clear CSS property, with the values left, right, both, or none, on the elements that follow the floated elements:
.element-to-clear {

clear: both;

}

Clearfix (the most common method): Apply the "clearfix" technique using a pseudo-element, which involves creating an invisible element to clear the floats. This method helps avoid adding extra markup to your HTML:
.group::after {

content: "";

display: table;

clear: both;

}

6.
What are the main differences between process and thread?

Hide Answer
process vs thread.webp

7.
How do you share code between files in JavaScript?

Hide Answer
JavaScript allows us to share code between files by ‘imports’ and ‘exports’. We can share code written in one file with another using ‘require’ and ‘module. exports’ statements in ES5 syntax, whereas we can use ‘import’ and ‘export’ statements in ES6 syntax.

8.
What is the difference between Host objects and Native objects?

Hide Answer
Native objects are pre-defined objects provided by JavaScript. These objects are available to all users globally, irrespective of the machine and environment.

On the other hand, host objects are environment-specific JavaScript objects, varying according to the machine environment we use.

9.
What is the best way to remove array duplicates in ES6?

Hide Answer
Using a set is the best way to remove duplicates from an array in ES6 because it only allows you to store unique values. When you convert the array to a set, it will remove any duplicate values. Then you need to convert the set back to an array with unique values.

10.
What is “Strict Mode,” and how to use it in JavaScript?

Hide Answer
Strict mode is a feature in JavaScript that allows us to execute the code in a restricted environment. It helps detect errors in the code that would normally get executed without any errors. We can enable strict mode by adding "use strict" at the top of the file or in the required function.
Example:

strictmode JS.webp

The string “use strict” at the top of the file tells the JavaScript interpreter to run the code in strict mode, which enforces stricter syntax and error handling rules. Next, we define a function called myFunction() that multiplies an undeclared variable x by 2 and returns the result. In non-strict mode, this would execute without any issues, but in strict mode, an error will be thrown because x is not declared.

11.
How does database indexing work?

Hide Answer
Database indexing is like indexing in a book. Just like an index in a book helps us find a particular chapter or information quickly, a database index helps locate the data quickly. It reduces the number of rows or columns to be checked and quickly finds the information you are looking for when a query with a “where” clause is executed. That's how database indexing works.

12.
What are filters in Vue.js?

Hide Answer
A filter is a JavaScript function that allows you to apply common text formatting to dynamic data. It doesn't change the data directly but only changes the output to a browser. It takes through value, manipulates it, and displays the processed values.

Filters are applied using the "pipe character (|) followed by the filter name. We can apply filters in two ways: local and global. Local filters can be used inside the component in which they are defined, whereas global filters can be used in any component.

13.
Why is "this" operator inconsistent in JavaScript?

Hide Answer
The "this" operator in JavaScript can be inconsistent because it can have different values based on where it is used. Its value is determined by how the function used is called rather than where it is declared. The value of "this" can also be changed using the call, apply, or bind functions making it difficult to predict the value of "this" in a given situation, which creates inconsistencies.

14.
What is Data Structure, and what are the different types?

Hide Answer
A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data (facts and figures) in a specialized format to retrieve it quickly and efficiently. Basically, there are two types of data structures:

Linear data structure:

Array: A linear collection of elements of the same type.
Stack: Elements are stored in the LIFO (a last-in, first-out) principle.
Queue: A queue data structure is based on the FIFO (a first-in, first-out) principle.
Linked list: It is a collection of elements, wherein each contains a reference to the next element.
Non-linear data structure:

Graph: A data structure that consists of vertices (nodes) and edges (links) that connects the vertices
Trees: A hierarchical data structure wherein each node has two child nodes
15.
What is the purpose of the 'main' element in HTML?

Hide Answer
The 'main' element in HTML represents the core content of a document. The content within the tag should be unique and not repeated across documents, such as sidebars, navigation links, search forms, etc. The element must be used only once in the HTML file. It requires a closing tag at the end of the content.

16.
What are semantic HTML tags, and why should you use them?

Hide Answer
Semantic HTML or semantic markup is the HTML that introduces the meaning to the webpage instead of just the presentation. For example, HTML elements such as header, footer, nav, main, article, p time, etc., are used to define the different sections and content on the page.

There are several reasons for using semantic HTML:

It helps search engines determine the importance and context of web pages.
Semantic HTML makes it easier to maintain a website as the code is easier to understand.
The pages built with semantic elements are more user-friendly and easier to read.
Semantic HTML is important for search engine optimization (SEO).
17.
What is Pascal String?

Hide Answer
A Pascal string is a data structure used to represent and manipulate text strings in some programming languages such as Pascal. In the context of full-stack development, it might not be as prominent as some other string representation methods, but it can still be encountered or used in certain situations.

Common types of Pascal strings are

Character arrays: These are numbers, letters, special characters, etc., enclosed in a single quote.

String variables: The variable of string type is declared inside the var block in Turbo Pascal.

Short strings: We use this string type when the total capacity remains constant.

Null terminated strings: This string type has the same structural layout as a C string.

AnsiStrings: This string type does not have any length limit.

18.
What is the difference between Map and WeakMap?

Hide Answer
A map accepts any type of value like string, boolean, number, etc., whereas a WeakMap only accepts only objects as keys.
Maps are iterable, but WeakMaps are not.
A “Map” has a size property, but a “WeakMap” does not have the same.
The garbage collector doesn’t remove any key pointer from "Map," but it removes the key pointer from "WeakMap".
19.
What is the main difference between a web server and an application server?

Hide Answer
A web server is designed to handle HTTP requests and is used to serve static content such as HTML pages, images, and other files to web browsers, whereas an application server is designed to handle dynamic content and is used to serve business logic and application functionality to clients
A web server is usually deployed in front of an application server to handle incoming web requests and serve static content, while the application server is responsible for processing dynamic requests and running business logic.
Web servers provide a runtime environment for websites and web applications, whereas application servers provide a runtime environment for enterprise applications.
Web servers don't support multi-threading, but the application server supports it.

How does DevOps work?

Hide Answer
DevOps is a technique that aims to build coordination to streamline software development and IT operations. It enables teams to work together to deliver software products faster and ensure better quality. The primary goal of DevOps is to increase efficiency and reduce errors.

Under a DevOps model, the development and operations teams are no longer "siloed." Sometimes, the two teams are merged into a single team. The DevOps engineers work across the complete application lifecycle - from development and testing to deployment and operations. These engineers have multidisciplinary skills.

22.
What is the main difference between Promises and async/await in JavaScript?

Hide Answer
Promises provide an interface for dealing with asynchronous operations, allowing chaining of .then() and .catch() methods. Async/await is a syntactic sugar built on top of Promises that makes asynchronous code look more like synchronous code, using async functions and the await keyword.

23.
Talk about multi-threading.

Hide Answer
A thread is defined as the single, sequential flow of the control within a program. It is not the program itself and cannot run on its own. In a running program, a thread may have to dig some of its resources.

For example, the execution stack and program counter must belong to that thread. The code in a given thread is useful only for that particular context. A single thread has a single point of execution, i.e., only one user can manage one request at a time.

Multi-threading is a process that is used to improve CPU performance. Through this process, multiple users can manage the program at the same time, or the same user can manage several requests simultaneously. Multi-threading is achieved by executing several processes that the operating system supports.

For example, a web browser has multi-threads running simultaneously - while you scroll through a page, you can simultaneously download an application or a document, listen to music, take a print in the background, and more.

What are the most popular methods of session management in servlet?

Hide Answer
There are three main methods of session management in servlet:

URL Rewriting: It is a session management method in which a unique session ID is added to every URL. When the browser requests a new page, the session ID is sent back to the server. It allows the server to associate the request with a specific session.

HttpSession: It is a built-in interface in Servlet used to store session data on the server side.

Cookies: Cookies are data sent by a servlet to a client's browser. The browser saves cookies and sends them back to the server in subsequent requests.

Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming.

Hide Answer
In synchronous programming, the program execution happens in a sequential and blocking manner. This means the code lines are executed one after the other, and the program has to wait for the current operation to finish before moving on to the next one.

On the other hand, asynchronous programming refers to a programming model where the program execution happens in a non-blocking and parallel manner. In this model, multiple tasks can run simultaneously, and the execution of one task does not depend on another.

What is the event loop in JavaScript?

Hide Answer
The event loop is a fundamental part of the JavaScript runtime environment. An event loop in JavaScript is a mechanism that executes tasks in a non-blocking manner. It continuously checks the message queue for new events to process and runs the corresponding event handlers.

It manages the execution of tasks and events, allowing the runtime to handle asynchronous operations such as network requests and file I/O without blocking the execution of other tasks.

Example:

29.
How will you prevent a bot from scraping a public API?

Hide Answer
It's impossible to completely prevent data scraping if the data within the API is publicly accessible. However, throttling is an effective way to deter bots from scraping a public API. It can prevent a device from making a certain number of requests within a specific time.

Moreover, an HTTP error should be thrown on exceeding a defined number of requests. Apart from this, a good bot detection solution can identify visitors' behavior and automatically block malicious bots that show signs of web scraping.

30.
Talk about connection leaks in Java and how they can be fixed.

Hide Answer
In Java, a connection leak refers to a situation where a database connection is not properly closed after it has been used, resulting in the connection being unavailable for reuse by other parts of the application or by other applications. This can lead to a gradual depletion of available connections and eventually cause the application to fail due to a lack of resources.

To fix a connection leak in Java, you must always close database connections explicitly after use, preferably in a final block, to ensure that the connection is closed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.

31.
How do you create a callback in JavaScript?

Hide Answer
JavaScript callback functions can be used synchronously and asynchronously. Callback functions are required because many actions are asynchronous, so they don't block a program or function from running until it is completed.

To create a callback function in JavaScript, we need to pass it as a parameter to another function and call it back when the task is completed.

Example:

callback in JS.webp

32.
What steps will you take to reduce a web application's load time?

Hide Answer

Place script references at the bottom of your HTML page.
Reduce the number of 301 redirects.
Enable browser caching to avoid reloading every time a user visits the page.
33.
What is the Zip() function in Python?

Hide Answer
Zip() is an inbuilt function in Python that takes iterable (such as lists, arrays, etc.) as input and returns a single iterator of tuples. Each tuple contains the n-th elements from each of the input iterables. The zip function combines elements from each of the iterables.

For example, if you have two lists [1, 2, 3,...] and [A, B, C,...], the zip function will combine them into a single list [(1, A), (2, B), (3, C),...].

34.
What is a deadlock in Java, and how to avoid it?

Hide Answer
Deadlock is a situation in Java when two or more threads are trying to access the same object. It happens only in the case of multi-threading. We can avoid a deadlock situation by using the following ways.

Avoid nested locks: Avoid giving a lock to multiple threads if we have already given it to one.

Use lock timeouts: We can specify a time for a thread to prevent it from waiting indefinitely for a lock.

Avoid Unnecessary Locks: Using locks unnecessarily can lead to a deadlock, and we should avoid it.

Use lock escalation: Lock escalation helps convert multiple locks into fewer ones, reducing the risk of deadlocks.

In React, explain the process of a component's lifecycle and the associated lifecycle methods.

Hide Answer
A React component goes through three main phases in its lifecycle: mounting, updating, and unmounting. In each phase, there are associated lifecycle methods. These methods can be used to manage state and side effects in a component's lifecycle:

Mounting: constructor, getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount.

Updating: getDerivedStateFromProps, shouldComponentUpdate, render, getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, componentDidUpdate.

Unmounting: componentWillUnmount.

6.
What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React?

Hide Answer
Controlled components have their form input values controlled by the component's state via event handlers, while uncontrolled components rely on the DOM to manage input state. Controlled components are used to ensure input validation, updates, and synchronization with the component's state, while uncontrolled components might be used if the DOM input state management suffices for simple inputs.

7.
Can you provide a brief example of useMemo and useCallback hooks in React?

Hide Answer
useMemo returns a memoized value, preventing unnecessary calculations if the inputs don't change. The useCallback memoizes a function to avoid redefining it on each render, which can be helpful when passing callbacks to child components.

Here's an example:

20.
How would you handle optimistic updates in a web application?

Hide Answer
Optimistic updates involve immediately updating the client-side state and UI to eflect a user action, assuming the server request will be successful. If the server request fails, the previous state is restored, and the user is notified about the error. Here's how to handle optimistic updates in a web application:

Capture the current state before performing an update.
Update the client-side state and UI immediately.
Send the update request to the server.
On server request success, confirm the update and maintain the client-side state.
On server request failure, restore the previous state and notify the user about the error.
This approach can be implemented using tools like Redux or Vuex for state management and can improve the perceived performance and responsiveness of the application.

21.
How would you implement error boundaries in a React application?

Hide Answer
Error boundaries are a mechanism provided by React to catch and handle errors in the component tree. To implement an error boundary, create a component that implements the componentDidCatch lifecycle method or static getDerivedStateFromError and wrap it around the desired components. Here's an example:

error-boundaries react.webp

22.
What is request blocking in web performance optimization and how can it be addressed?

Hide Answer
Request blocking occurs when the browser is forced to wait for a resource (e.g., a script, a stylesheet, or a font) to be fetched and processed before it can continue rendering the DOM or executing subsequent scripts. To address request blocking:

Use async or defer attributes on script tags to allow downloading and execution without blocking rendering.
Load CSS stylesheets using media attribute or JavaScript to prevent blocking.
Minimize the use of render-blocking custom web fonts or use the font-display property to control their loading behavior.
Use efficient resource loading strategies like prioritizing critical resources and lazy-loading non-critical resources.
23.
Can you explain the concept of atomic design in modern web design?

Hide Answer
Atomic design is a methodology for creating design systems by breaking down the user interface into five hierarchical component levels:

Atoms: Basic building blocks, like HTML tags, buttons, inputs, or labels.
Molecules: Combinations of atoms that form a simple functional unit, such as a search form.
Organisms: Combinations of molecules and/or atoms to form a more complex, reusable section of the interface, like a header or sidebar.
Templates: Layouts that combine organisms and other UI elements to form a page structure.
Pages: Instances of templates filled with actual content to represent the final design.
This method allows for a systematic, modular, and scalable approach to web design and development.
