Complete rebuild of their old Magento 1 shop in Magento 2. For improved performance, security, and developer experience we use Magento 2 as a headless CMS and eCommerce platform. The frontend was built as a PWA in Vue Storefront, allowing us to use Vue, Express (as a middleware API of sorts), and ElasticSearch for the data storage.
